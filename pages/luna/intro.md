{lu}hii, i'm luna! deer full of Thoughts at all times{!}

{lu}i'm a certified Computer User, having a decent list of [projects](./projects.md) under my belt in a fair variety of programming languages, including my own! well, not certified *yet*, still on my way to a CS degree, but we'll get there!{!}

{lu}i'm also probably the person that brought you to this page, having been our only [fronter](../plurality.md) until recently. now i share that role with [lilly](../lilly/intro.md), so you best get familiar with her }:3{!}

{lu}oh, what else... i always have so much to say, until i sit down to write it...{!}
