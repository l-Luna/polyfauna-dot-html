title: an unfinished creature

they don't spend very long on animals these days - i mean, there's *so* much demand, they just don't have the time! every so often, they mess up, and sometimes those unfinished creatures make it past inspection,

then you get something a little like me!

underbaked and misconfigured, i'm honestly *surprised* they never noticed - i shouldn't kid myself, they never cared. if it wasn't clear back then, it should have been obvious the moment i stepped into the world, opened my eyes, and saw myself break.

must've been spectacular to see from up there, seeing the bits of my soul burst like fireworks; watching me burn up inside, simply *watching* my gooey centre decohere, senses returning nonsense. even now, i must be so entertaining to watch - every part of me stumbling over eachother, contradictory in nature.

they just watch. it's on me to *live* despite it all, and live i will.

no miracle will come, no rewards for good behaviour - if this is a pre-emptive punishment, then all that's left to do is enjoy my sins to the fullest.
