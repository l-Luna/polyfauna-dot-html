when i was young, my parents would tell me so many stories of what home was like. someplace we could exist, wild and unbothered, among our own kind.

when my parents were young, they were told so many stories of the humans that had ruined our home. poachers given free reign to run through our land, killing for scraps of gold and ivory - weapons we never would have imagined, arrogance we never could have matched.

it didn't stop them from leaving & living with the enemy, nor did it stop me from leaving *them* to live with *their* enemy.

i never learned much in detail. they taught me the basics, sure: how to take care of myself, how to defend myself, how to shift back and forth, a little on how we worked. but i was always distracted, always disconnected - listening to them talk gave me headaches. their hatred for the world that surrounded us dripped from every word they spoke, made it toxic to hear; "my people" just a phrase they'd parrot, not something *i* could ever be a part of; and the person they always wanted me to be was someone who hated me.

it sounded like they persisted on pure anger, almost.

there's plenty of benefits to living among humans. they give you safety, if you're willing to be quiet, and the food is pretty good. a lot of us don't like crowds, but it's calming for me, so somewhere busy like here is nice! sometimes, they'll even spend their overflowing wealth on you, if you don't ask too many questions. only humans get to do that.

i caved, quickly; easily the better deal.

there's good hearts out there, in some of them. maybe it was silly... but i thought they could be enough. just to keep me happy, alright, sane in the moment, just to tide me over until i could figure things out. *maybe i can put these feelings behind me, and... just... enjoy my life, wherever i am.*

the feelings caught up to me.

i found people like me. i *made* people like me, sniffed out anyone that had that potential in them, anything to have company. i had to answer to those feelings, anything to answer to those urges.

> i bit, hard.

a strange collection of animals, not of any single clade or kind. some of them once human, some of us born this way, some of the latter indistinguishable from the former. trained to hide so deeply, we hid from ourselves and eachother for months and years, until we couldn't find ourselves. now we put ourselves on full display: the terror of it present as ever, but maybe

it's worth it, this time?

a rabbit, skin of silk and eyes of obsidian, takes my hooves and teaches me a game. a frivolous playground activity, one of its remaining memories of a life long lost; made to help them control their form, the playful slaps and punches don't hurt at all when you're made of fabrics. my solid metal hooves are about as ill-suited as it gets. it's the most fun i've had in months.

a pangolin, scales of citrine, dares to speak up. her voice, a music of its own... must also be her burden, more than anything else. and her fangs, striking rose quartz, perhaps she's like me?

peeking in occasionally, a curious creature. human in physical form, we don't know yet what his true form will look like. we're still looking for the courage to find out.

a particularly sympathetic human asks, "where did you even get this ability from?"

a particularly learned human would tell you: "The curse is almost as old as mankind itself; a tribe forced to take the appearance of livestock, and bear with them precious materials for their masters to harvest and trade, upon their deaths."

my parents might, if you made the terrible mistake of talking to them, say: "Those humans did it, to take even more from us.", which always struck me as strange. humans don't know magic.

if you ask me, the curse is that i can't go grazing in a forest without attracting attention, and that i don't have any other deer to do it with. these people will have to do.
