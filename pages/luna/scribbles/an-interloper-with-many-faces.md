my office is empty, clean, and silent. nothing stays here for long; no untouched paperwork nor untouched pleasantries adorn my desk, only the quiet tune of the wind outside reminding you of its connection to the world outside. nothing wants to stay here for long.

soon, our little chit-chat will be interrupted by an unwelcome visitor. I am sorry to cut it short so early, but I have work to do.

an animal stands in my office. its form is furred, clawed, wide-eyed, aggression visible in its stance; yet bipedal, holding back the worst of its nature. for the moment, at least.

it isn't supposed to be here. or anywhere, for that matter, its kind are usually clever enough not to show themselves so brazenly. and yet here it is, this *interloper* with many faces interrupting me with a *horribly* aggressive mask. perhaps it will swap it for something worse yet?
