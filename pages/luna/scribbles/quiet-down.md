everytime the witch opens its mouth, it's quickly reminded not to. it's not that anyone in particular is *trying* to shut it up, just, nobody in particular really wants to hear it speak.

it's nobody's fault in particular that the discussion always drifts to its peers, their interests and their in-jokes. it's nobody's fault in particular that it wasn't around for this or that, it just didn't seem interested and nobody thought to ask. really, nobody's to blame that, despite being surrounded by these warm, loving, Real people, the witch remains but a bystander.

but its a curious thing, and people are interesting creatures, so it comes up with a little spell to see what it might be like to be one; nothing as extreme as impersonation or false love, simply:
- once a day, the target will give the witch a glance (without prompting).
- once a week, the target will mention something that the witch had done, related to whatever they were talking about.
- once a month, the target will tell the witch something they had noticed about it of their own accord (without prompting).

it only cast it once, and they never noticed when it began or ended. the witch did, and barely made through three weeks; the happiness of being seen quickly soured by its forced nature, and later poisoned by the inevitable, waiting jealousy.

and so it sits away again, letting those Real others enjoy their time without burdening them with its presence.
