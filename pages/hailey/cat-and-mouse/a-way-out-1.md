# a way out...?

{ha} oh hey, a doorway opened up! maybe it's a shortcut, do you think we should take it? {!}

{li}no, absolutely not, we'll be stuck here another day if you try. also, I don't suppose you have any good reason to drag me along?{!}

{ha} cursed door wouldn't let us out otherwise. {!}

{li}nevermind, I'm not dealing with this.{!}
