{lu}hell yeah{!}

{lu}ok, so, consider the following setup: a boulder is rolling down a ski slope, and left to its own devices, it'll run over some unknown number of skiiers (bad!). thankfully, you're at just the right place to push it once, out of the way, into something else:{!}

- {lu}`a lodge` further down the slope, that might withstand it{!}
- {lu}try to `stop it yourself`{!}
- {lu}`a frozen lake` to the side, where some birds have taken up dancing{!}

{lu}what will it be?{!}

{ha} poor birds 3: {!}
