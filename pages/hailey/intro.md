{ha} welcome... to my wonderful abode! here you will find all sorts of trickery afoot, but at the end you will be rewarded with- {!}

{ha} hold on, I shouldn't to be so hasty to reveal it *just* yet! that would defeat the whole point of the winding labyrinth *at least*, and the trick mirrors would definitely get more boring. go [figure it out yourself](./cat-and-mouse/doorway.md) first! {!}

<summary>{ha} finished yet? {!}</summary>

{ha} it is a dark night, well past any reasonable time to be awake. all the lights are out, every door and window shut, all but one. you vow never to investigate again. {!}

{ha} anyways! I'm hailey, as you've *probably* guessed by now, and I'm really cool, as you *might* have noticed, and I'm so so so fluffy, as you *probably did not* notice but absolutely deserves mentioning. uh what else. {!}

{ha} so I'm just here to be a friend really, no deep purpose or crazy shennanigans going on like *some* people. I think I'm pretty good at that! oh, originally I was supposed to be a fox or something but I kind of just wasn't feeling it, so... {!}

{ha} I won't front much on my own, but you can always say *hi* and I'll get back to you sometime! people are fun :3 {!}
