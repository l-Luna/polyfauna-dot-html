{dy}First and foremost, I am here to take care of my precious Chloe, to keep them out of harm's way no matter the circumstance. Then, I am here to facilitate communication between us, breaking the barriers that once plagued our attempts at working as one. Finally, I am here to live, my flame commanding me forward into the unknown.{!}

{dy}I'm yet unsure what the future holds for me, or us, but I have confidence we will create something worth living, and that I will find a space for myself within it.{!}
