{li}hi, I'm Lilly! baaah, or something{!}

{li}I've been up to a couple of things, including writing the code behind the website you're looking at now! and many, many unfinished smaller things, like a text editor that didn't get very far...{!}

{li}I try to be calm and understanding, and put my thoughts clearly; though I have also been accused of being "{lu}mean{!}" and "{lu}kind of edgy{!}", all criticisms safe to discard.{!}

{li}I'm the oldest person here, and one of our two fronters, alongside [Luna](../luna/intro.md). it's been a turbulent journey trying to understand plurality, and all these creatures I'm so lucky to live with, but I'm glad we're starting to figure things out. honestly, I'm just glad to be still be around to say hi.{!}
