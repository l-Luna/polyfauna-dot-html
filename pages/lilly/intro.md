{li}hi, I'm Lilly! baaah, and so on.{!}

{li}I try to be calm and understanding, and put my thoughts straightforwardly, and I would appreciate having the same done in return. I'm unafraid to point out and be stubborn about issues that I notice, though.{!}

{li}I'm one of our two fronters, alongside [Luna](../luna/intro.md), and the oldest person here. I'm also responsible for putting together this website, and for starting our interest in programming too.{!}
