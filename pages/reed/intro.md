{re}yeah, it's me, the legendary reed. don't have much to say, don't care to talk much either, i've got better things to care about. besides, my headmates' friends are not really my type; don't assume you're buddies with me because you're close with one of them.{!}

{re}managed to be the only guy here, have the most convoluted origin story, _and_ earn the official title of "most abrasive asshole around"... but all i'm doing is pointing out the obvious.{!}
